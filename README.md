Hi, 
Welcome to my simple demo game that demonstrates the possibilities of ascii art games. This was made in such a way that it doesn't need pygame.

To play it run it in any python editor that supports print(), ansi ecsape codes and pynput.  
(Pynput runs best localy on your PC, so that excludes Git codespace)

How to play:
Use your keyboard arrow keys to move around in the 'air' (You are skydiving!).
Move your player: 'ç' to fly thru the hoops. (and earn skycoins. Not supported yet)
Press your escape key to end the game.
